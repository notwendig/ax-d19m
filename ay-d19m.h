 * K4W26BF
 * 4 Keys Binary + Facility Code, Wiegand 26-Bit
 * This option buffers 4 keys and outputs keypad data with a three-digit
 * Facility code like a standard 26-bit card output.
 * The Facility code is set in Programming Menu number four and can be
 * in the range 000 to 255. The factory default setting for the Facility
 * code is 000 (see Section 5.6).
 * The keypad PIN code must be 4 digits long and can range between
 * 0000 and 9999. On the fourth key press of the 4-digit PIN code, the
 * data is sent across the Wiegand data lines as binary data in the same
 * format as a 26-bit card.
 * If * or # is pressed during PIN code entry, the keypad clears the PIN
 * code entry buffer, generates a beep and is ready to receive a new 4-
 * digit keypad PIN code.
 * If the entry of the 4-digit keypad PIN code is disrupted and no number
 * key is pressed within 5 seconds, the keypad clears the PIN code entry
 * buffer, generates a beep, and is ready to receive a new 4-digit keypad
 * PIN code.

 *
 * K5W26FC
 * 1 to 5 Keys + Facility Code, Wiegand 26-Bit
 * This option buffers up to 5 keys and outputs keypad data with a
 * Facility code like a 26-bit card output.
 * The Facility code is set in Programming Menu number four and can be
 * in the range 000 to 254. The factory default setting for the Facility
 * code is 000 (see Section 5.6).
 * The keypad PIN code can be one to five digits long and can range
 * between 1 and 65,535. When entering a keypad PIN code that is less
 * than 5 digits long, # must be pressed to signify the end of PIN code
 * entry. For keypad PIN codes that are 5 digits long, on the fifth key
 * press of the 5-digit PIN code, the data is sent across the Wiegand data
 * lines as binary data in the same format as a 26-bit card.
 * If * or # is pressed during PIN code entry or a PIN code greater than
 * 65,535 is entered, the keypad clears the PIN code entry buffer,
 * generates a beep and is ready to receive a new 4-digit keypad PIN
 * code.
 * If the entry of the 1- to 5-digit keypad PIN code is disrupted and a
 * number key or # is not pressed within 5 seconds, the keypad clears
 * the PIN code entry buffer, generates a medium length beep and is
 * ready to receive a new 1 to 5-digit keypad PIN code.

 * 6 Keys BCD and Parity Bits, Wiegand 26-Bit
 * Sends buffer of 6 keys, adds parity and sends a 26-bit BCD message.
 * Each key is a four bit equivalent of the decimal number.
 * The keypad PIN code must be 6 key presses long. On the sixth key
 * press of the 6-digit PIN code, the data is sent across the Wiegand data
 * lines as a BCD message.
 * If the entry of the 6-digit keypad PIN code is disrupted and a number
 * key or # is not pressed within 5 seconds, the keypad clears the PIN
 * code entry buffer, generates a medium length beep and is ready to

 *
 * SK3X4MX
 * Single Key, 3x4 Matrix Keypad (MD-P64)
 * This unidque mode is intended to let the host controller scan the AY-
 * Dx9M keypad while still keeping the proximity card readers Wiegand
 * 26-Bit or Clock & Data formats active.
 * An optional interface board must be used between the AY-Dx9M and
 * the host system. Each key press is immediately sent on DATA0 as an
 * ASCII character at a baud rate of 9600 bits per second.
 * When a key is pressed, DATA1 is pulled "low" until the key is
 * released at which point DATA1 is set to "high". This allows the
 * controller to detect the duration of the key press.
 * The MD-P64 interface unit outputs the data received to 7 outputs
 * emulating a keyboard. The interface unit does not affect any data
 * that it receives from the proximity reader whether it is Wiegand 26-Bit
 * or Clock & Data.
 * Key pressed = ASCII Value
 * 0 = '0' (0x30 hex) 6 = '6' (0x36 hex)
 * 1 = '1' (0x31 hex) 7 = '7' (0x37 hex)
 * 2 = '2' (0x32 hex) 8 = '8' (0x38 hex)
 * 3 = '3' (0x33 hex) 9 = '9' (0x39 hex)
 * 4 = '4' (0x34 hex) *= '*' (0x2A hex)
 * 5 = '5' (0x35 hex) # = '#' (0x23 hex)
 *
 * K8CDBCD
 * 1 to 8 Keys BCD, Clock & Data
 * Buffers up to 8 keys and outputs keypad data without a facility code
 * like standard Clock and Data card output.
 * The keypad PIN code can be one to eight digits long. The PIN code
 * length is selected while programming the reader for Option 8. The
 * reader transmits the data when it receives the last key press of the PIN
 * code. The data is sent across the two data output lines as binary data
 * in Clock & Data format.
 * If * or # is pressed during PIN code entry, the keypad clears the PIN
 * code entry buffer, generates a beep, and is ready to receive a new
 * keypad PIN code.
 * If the entry of the keypad PIN code is disrupted and a number key or
 * # is not pressed within 5 seconds, the keypad clears the PIN code
 * entry buffer, generates a medium length beep and is ready to receive
 * a new keypad PIN code.
